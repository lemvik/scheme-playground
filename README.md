# Scheme playground

This repository contains code that I wrote to learn Scheme programming language.

It mostly uses Chez Scheme dialect (R6RS) but I tried to maintain at least a glimmer of hope for portability (hence, portability library).

## Building

As an excercise, I've written build-application library that tries to create a whole-program-optimized program to be run. See `descriptor.json` for build definition.

## TODO

1. [ ] Testing "framework"
2. [ ] Tests for exposed functionality
3. [ ] External libraries loading
